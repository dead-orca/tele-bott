## ⚠️ IMPORTANT RULES

- ✅ **KEEP the window open** - Bot only works while it's running
- ✅ **Don't close the window** - Bot will stop if you close it
- ✅ **Check the window** - You should see "Bot is starting..."

## 🛑 TO STOP THE BOT

- In the window, press `Ctrl + C`
- Then close the window

## ❌ IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK

1. **Check the window** - Does it show "Bot is starting..."?
   - If NO → There's an error (tell me what you see)
   - If YES → Continue to step 2

2. **Check Telegram** - Are you messaging your bot username?
   - Make sure it's the correct bot username

3. **Restart** - Close the window, then start again

4. **Check internet** - Make sure you have internet connection

## 📝 WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE

When the bot starts correctly, you'll see:
```
Bot is starting...
```

That's it! The bot is running and ready to receive messages.

## 🎉 SUCCESS!

If you see "Bot is starting..." in the window, your bot is working!
Just test it in Telegram by sending `/start` to your bot username
