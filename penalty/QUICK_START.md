# 🚀 QUICK START - Get Your Bot Working NOW!

## ✅ I Fixed the Problem!

The issue was a compatibility problem between Python 3.13 and the old telegram library version. **I've updated it!**

## 🎯 How to Start Your Bot (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Open Command Prompt
- Press `Win + R`
- Type `cmd`
- Press Enter

### Step 2: Go to Your Bot Folder
Copy and paste this:
```
cd C:\Users\chari\OneDrive\Bureau\penalty
```

### Step 3: Start the Bot
Copy and paste this:
```
python bot.py
```

**You should see:**
```
Bot is starting...
```

## ✅ Keep the Window Open!

- **DON'T CLOSE** the Command Prompt window
- The bot only works while this window is open
- You'll see messages when people use your bot

## 🧪 Test Your Bot

1. **Open Telegram** on your phone or computer
2. **Search for**: Your bot username
3. **Click "Start"** or send `/start`
4. **Your bot should respond!** 🎉

## 🛑 To Stop the Bot

- In the Command Prompt window, press `Ctrl + C`
- Then close the window

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The bot **MUST be running** for it to respond
- If you close the window, the bot stops working
- For 24/7 operation, you need to host it online (see SIMPLE_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

1. Make sure the Command Prompt window shows "Bot is starting..."
2. Make sure you're messaging your bot (not a different bot)
3. Try restarting: Close the window, then run `python bot.py` again

## 🎉 That's It!

Your bot should now work! Just keep that Command Prompt window open and test it in Telegram.
